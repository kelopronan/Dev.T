## 🧠 About Me

I'm a curious and determined 12th Grader, currently prepping for the **SAT** while diving deep into programming. I thrive on understanding systems from the ground up and enjoy writing code that’s not just functional — but meaningful.

- 🧩 Love solving logical problems  
- 💬 Believe in building strong fundamentals  
- 📚 Planning my undergrad in India, followed by a master's in the US  
- ⚡ Code clean, stay consistent, improve every day
